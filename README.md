## 🧪 How to run the tests

### Requirements for testing

- Node.js installed
- Development dependencies installed:

  npm install --save-dev mocha @types/mocha ts-node sinon @types/sinon

- It’s recommended to run `npm install` to ensure all project dependencies are installed.

### Running the tests

In the terminal, run:

  npm test

Or, if you prefer, run only the tests with:

  npm run test

The tests are located in the `tests/` folder and cover both the visual creation of the status bar item and the display of CPU, RAM, and temperature values (mocked).
